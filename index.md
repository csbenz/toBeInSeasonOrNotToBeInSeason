<h1>Introduction</h1>

Surveys show that most people don't know anything about food seasons [0]. With the globalisation of our society, food is transported around the world and most fruits and vegetables can be found all year round on the supermarket's shelves. Vegetables and fruits used to grow in your garden or were bought from the local farmer, and this locality forced eating seasonal food.

The transportation of food is a large factor of pollution, with trucks and cargos moving the food around the globe, sometimes several times.

In this story we analyze when and how food is consumed in America, and if the food is consumed according to its season.

We base our data on user rating dates from large cooking recipe websites which were scrapped by Stanford's infolab.
